Workflow
1. Broadcaster Signs into App
2. Broadcaster Turns On Game/Updates Settings
3. Game Creates "Start Quest" Reward
4. User redeems "Start Quest" Reward
5. Game received "Start Quest" redemption
6. Game Try to start
    6a. If Game is already started, reject redemption (multiple people starting at once)
    6b. If game is not started, accept redemption and mark complete
    6c. If overlay is turned on, a "timed" game can be started
    6d. If overlay is turned off, only an HP game can be started (we are not running a server to check for timing, the overlay will be used to track timers).
    6e. Choose Quest
        6ei. How do we choose quest?
7. Game deletes "Start Quest" Reward
8. Game posts in chat/pushes to ovarlay game starting information
9. Game creates action Rewards for current boss HP level
10. Users redeem actions
11. Game increments current HP on each redemption.
    11a. If redemption comes in after HP is 0, reject redemption (timing if boss already killed)
    11b. If boss still has HP, increment, and complete redemption
12. If boss HP goes below 0 on an action, delete rewards, complete round.

Gotchas:
1a. If overlay is turned off mid game, stop game, game will convert to "HP only" game. If overlay comes back online, timers are lost and cannot be restarted.
1b. If overlay is disconnected, we can resume timer as long as overlay still is counting down in memory.
